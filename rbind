###`rbind`
####Lauren Ashlock

- rbind takes a sequence of vector, matrix, or data-frame areguments and combines them by rows.    
- Arguments: are vectors or matrices, that can be given as named arguments.   
- deparse.level is an integer argument that controls the construction of labels in the case of non-matrix-like arguments. The default is 0, which constructs no labels. 1 or 2 constructs labels from the argument names   
- make.row.names is an argument that is only used when binding data frames. It is a logical argument that indicates if unique and valid row.names should be constructed fromt the arguments.   
- stringsAsFactors is a logical argument that is passed to as.data.frame. This only has an effect when the arguments contain a non-data.frame) character   

```{r}
#example

m<- rbind(1,1:7)
m
m <- rbind(m, 8:14) 
m 

#deparse.level argument

dd<- 10
rbind(1:4, c=2, "a++"=10, deparse.level =0) #this names the rows of the middle two arguments

rbind(1:4, c=2, "a++"=10, dd, deparse.level=1) #this names the last three arguments (this is the default setting)

rbind(1:4, c=2, "a++" =10, dd, deparse.level=2) #takes the names from each element

```
